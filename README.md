# Advent of Code 2020

Having fun with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), as this is now my third year doing it all in Clojure.
I'm going to try and make little blog of each day, explaning how I came to my solutions and how to read them.
Originally I thought of fully explaining this to non-Clojurists, but other folks can explain the language better
than I.  So I'll assume the reader can follow along with a basic understanding of Lisp/Clojure, and I'll try to
fill in the blanks when I'm able.

_Warning:_ I write long explanations. So... yeah.
